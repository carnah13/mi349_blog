<p>Hello, my name is Randy and I am a sophmore at Michigan State University. I am 
currently pursuing a degree in computer science engeineering with a cognate
in media and information. In my free time I enjoy hanging out with my friends, working,
and playing video games. Following is a list of some of my favorite game series.</p>

<p>Outside of school I enjoy going to work at Meijer where I am a service coordinator. 
I met a lot of my friend group there and enjoy doing any dumb things we can together. We've
taken trips to Disney, Georgia, and to the Upper Peninsula. My closest friend Paige and I
are currently planning another trip to Disney.</p>
